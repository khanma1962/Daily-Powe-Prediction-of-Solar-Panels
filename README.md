# Daily-Powe-Prediction-of-Solar-Panels


Business question to be asked.
1 - Given the data predict the solar power for the next year. 2 - Does seasonality - such as winter, summer, spring, etc. - plays a role in power generated per day? 3 - Is there a variation during different time of the day (morning, noon, evening)? 4 - Considering the dollar per watts charged by utility company, how much one can save in on month/one year? 5 - If total cost of installation is 25K for 5KW system, how long will it take to pay off the cost of system?
